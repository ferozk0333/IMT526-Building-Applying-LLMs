Then, I trained an autoencoder — the encoder compresses high-dimensional word vectors into a 5-dimensional latent space, and the decoder reconstructs the input. The idea is to learn a compressed representation of each sentence. We used Binary Cross Entropy since the inputs are binary, and trained it using the Adam optimizer."
